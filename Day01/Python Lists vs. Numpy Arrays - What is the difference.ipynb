    "Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers. The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n",

    "**To overcome this problem, we use NumPy arrays that contain only homogeneous elements, i.e. elements having the same data type**. This makes it more efficient at storing and manipulating the array. This difference becomes apparent when the array has a large number of elements, say thousands or millions. **Also, with NumPy arrays, you can perform element-wise operations, something which is not possible using Python lists!**\n",
